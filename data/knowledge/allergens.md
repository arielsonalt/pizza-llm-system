# Pizza Chop – Allergens (per pizza)

**Legend (major allergens):**
- **Gluten/Wheat**: pizza dough (standard crust)
- **Milk**: cheese/dairy (mozzarella, parmesan, provolone, gorgonzola, catupiry)
- **Egg**: egg as a topping
- **Fish**: tuna
- **Shellfish/Crustaceans**: shrimp
- **Soy (possible)**: may be present in **processed meats** (sausage, pepperoni, ham, bacon) and some **BBQ sauces** depending on supplier

> Notes:
> - This is based on the ingredient descriptions in the menu; exact allergens can vary by supplier/recipe.
> - Cross-contamination is possible in a shared kitchen (gluten, dairy, etc.).
> - If you need strict allergen control (e.g., celiac disease), confirm preparation and ingredients.
